          Hi there ðŸ‘‹
          <br />

            My name is Igor and I'm a young developer from Poland.
          </p>
          <p className="mx-2">
            I'm interested in all kinds of things but mostly in js frameworks
            and libraries, such as React, React-native Node.js, Express.js,
            Next.js, etc.
          </p>
          <p className="mx-2">You can see my projects in the projects tab.</p>
          <p className="mx-2">
            I also never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down, never
            gonna run around and desert you, never gonna make you cry, never
            gonna say goodbye, never gonna tell a lie and hurt you. (copilot
